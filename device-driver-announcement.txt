Linux Kernel Modules

This month's Linux Users Group meeting will be an introduction to 
writing linux kernel modules. The meeting format will be a hands-on 
project guided by other LUG members, instead of the standard lecture. 

Kernel modules written by developers outside the core linux team are 
usually for device drivers. While we won't be developing for an actual 
device, there are some features all kernel modules share that can be 
used as a template for your own driver. 

All participants will work through writing, building and testing a 
simple kernel module exposing a character device interface to userland. 

Linux kernel modules are almost always written in C and that's the 
language we will be using.

System requirements for those wishing to participate will be posted 
on the Linux Users Group forum. [link] If you are unable to bring in 
a system with the minimal requirements you will still be able to work 
along with someone else. 

Users with kernel development experience are encouraged to attend to 
help provide assistance.
